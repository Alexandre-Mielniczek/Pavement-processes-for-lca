# Pavement-processes-for-lca
LCI datasets for road pavement construction and maintenance, based on literature and French context.

# Pavement related processes.bw2package
This file is a Brightway export in .bw2package format.

Content: life cycle inventory of processes related to road pavement construction and maintenance (asphalt production, transport, paving, milling, sweeping, etc.).
Use: can be directly imported into Brightway2 or Brightway25 with the import_bw2package function.
Purpose: to enable reuse and comparison in LCA studies.

# Pavement related processes.xlsx
This file is a tabular export in Excel format.

Content: same inventory as the .bw2package file, presented in spreadsheet form for review and verification.
Structure: sheets describing processes, energy consumption, materials, and emissions.
Purpose: to make data inspection easier without Brightway and ensure transparency of the source inventory.

# Pavement processes methodology.pdf
This PDF document provides the methodological note used to build the life cycle inventory of pavement-related processes.

Content: detailed description of construction and maintenance operations (asphalt plant, transport, paving equipment, milling, sweeping, etc.), with data sources and calculation assumptions.
Purpose: to document the background of the inventory and ensure transparency of data selection and modeling choices.
